# [GalaxyMenu](https://minuwu.github.io/galaxyMenu/)

## Description

This project is a **responsive galaxy-themed burger menu interface** built with HTML and CSS. It uses a hidden checkbox input (`tick / untick`) to control the opening and closing of a sliding drawer menu without relying on JavaScript. A burger icon toggles the menu drawer, while a close icon provides a smooth exit. The menu includes styled navigation links with Font Awesome icons, as well as fixed-position social media buttons. The design features a galaxy background with subtle glowing animations, hover effects, and responsive adjustments for smaller devices, creating a visually appealing and interactive user experience.
